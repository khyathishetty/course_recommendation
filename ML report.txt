METHODOLOGY:

a.Description of the preprocessing. 

1. Skill Assignment and Comparison:
Random Skill Assignment: The random() function was used to randomly assign skills (e.g., Python, Java) to each student in the dataset.
Skill Numerical Encoding: Each skill was assigned a unique numerical value (e.g., Python: 1, Java: 2).
Skillset Comparison: Student and company skill sets were compared by iterating through each skill and checking if the student possessed the required skill (as indicated by the corresponding numerical value present in the company's skill set).

 2. Data Transformation:
Binary Outcome Creation: The comparison results ("Yes" for being fit for the company, "No" for not) were   converted into binary format (1 for being fit for the company, 0 for not).
CSV File Generation: The processed data, including student skills, company skills, and the binary comparison outcome for each skill pair, was saved as a CSV file using the pandas library.

b.Description of the machine learning techniques/algorithms/models used.

K-Means Clustering: We applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to group students into three clusters based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). This technique identifies groups (clusters) with similar CGPA values, allowing for targeted analysis.

Scatter Plot Visualization: A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between student skills and their respective CGPA clusters. This visualization provided insights into potential skill variations across different academic performance levels.

Rule-Based Matching: We implemented a rule-based system to compare student skills with company skill requirements. Individual if-else statements determined whether a student possessed each required skill for a specific company. This approach offered a clear and interpretable way to assess student-company skill alignment.

Eligible Company List Generation: Based on the skill matching results, a new dataset was created. This dataset contained student names and all the companies they were eligible for, considering their skills.

Decision Tree Model: A decision tree algorithm was employed to analyze the generated dataset containing student-company eligibility information. Decision trees excel at handling discrete data (e.g., skills possessed/not possessed) and provide a clear interpretable model for understanding the reasoning behind recommendations.

Confusion Matrix Evaluation: To assess the performance of the decision tree model, a confusion matrix was generated. This matrix visualizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, providing valuable insights into its accuracy and potential for improvement.

Leveraging Decision Tree Results: By analyzing the decision tree's structure and predictions, we built a course recommendation system. This system identifies skills that could enhance students' eligibility for their desired companies based on the learned decision rules. These recommendations aim to guide students in selecting courses that can potentially improve their skillsets and increase their chances of being placed in their preferred companies.

c.Justification for the chosen techniques/algorithms/models

K-Means clustering is a simple and efficient unsupervised learning algorithm, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis when initial group structures are unknown. In this case, we aimed to identify potential subgroups within the student population based on their CGPA.
Visualization with scatter plots provides a clear visual representation of skill distribution across CGPA clusters. This helps in understanding potential correlations or trends between academic performance and skill sets.
A rule-based approach with conditional statements offers a straightforward way to compare student skills and company requirements. It's suitable for situations where the decision-making process is well-defined and relatively simple.
Creating a new dataset based on the matching results streamlines the data for subsequent analysis and model training (decision tree in this case).
